## Session A: Basic Programs
Practice Java fundamentals using datatypes, operators, and control statements.

1. **Palindrome Check**  
   Write a program to check if a given string is a palindrome (e.g., "MALAYALAM").
2. **Character Frequency**  
   Write a program to find the frequency of a given character in a string. **(Mandatory)**  
3. **Matrix Multiplication**  
   Write a program to multiply two matrices. **(Mandatory)**

## Session B: Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
Learn constructors, inheritance, method overloading/overriding, polymorphism, and garbage collection.

4. **Employee Details**  
   Create a class `Employee` with attributes like name, age, phone number, address, and salary. Derive `Officer` and `Manager` classes with specific attributes. Demonstrate inheritance. **(Mandatory)**  
5. **Abstract Class Shape**  
   Create an abstract class `Shape` with a method `numberOfSides()`. Implement this in subclasses `Rectangle`, `Triangle`, and `Hexagon`. Demonstrate polymorphism. **(Mandatory)**  
6. **Garbage Collection**  
   Write a program to demonstrate the use of the garbage collector.

---

## Session C: File Handling and Input/Output Management
Practice file handling, reading, and writing operations.

7. **Reader/Writer Program**  
   Write a file handling program using reader/writer.  
8. **File Exception Handling**  
   Write a program to read from a file and write to another file while handling exceptions. **(Mandatory)**  
9. **Integer Line Parsing**  
   Read a line of integers, display each integer, and compute their sum using `StringTokenizer`. **(Mandatory)**

---

## Session D: Exception Handling and Multi-threading
Work with exceptions and multi-threaded programming.

10. **Exception Handling Basics**  
    Write a program using `try`, `catch`, `throws`, and `finally`. **(Mandatory)**  
11. **Multi-threaded Program**  
    Create a program with three threads:
    - First thread generates random integers every second.
    - If the integer is even, the second thread computes its square.
    - If the integer is odd, the third thread computes its cube.  
12. **Thread Synchronization**  
    Demonstrate thread synchronization. **(Mandatory)**

---

## Session E: Graphics Programming
Explore Java Swing for GUI-based applications.

13. **Simple Calculator**  
    Build a calculator using Java Swing with exception handling for divide-by-zero. **(Mandatory)**  
14. **Traffic Light Simulation**  
    Create a traffic light simulator with radio buttons for red, yellow, and green lights. Only one light should be on at a time. **(Mandatory)**  
15. **Database Connectivity**  
    Display all records from a database table using JDBC.

---

## Session F: Standard Searching and Sorting Algorithms
Implement searching and sorting algorithms with data structures.

16. **Doubly Linked List Operations**  
    - Create a doubly linked list.
    - Delete a specific element.
    - Display the list contents. **(Mandatory)**  
17. **Quick Sort**  
    Implement Quick Sort to sort a list of names in ascending order. **(Mandatory)**  
18. **Binary Search**  
    Implement Binary Search to find an element in a list.
